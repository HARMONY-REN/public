# HARMONY連

This README is dedicated to plot a vague idea of the working group HARMONY連 that aims to develop innovative works with humanity in mind.  
To whoever wants to learn from our materials or wants to join HARMONY連, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/t68awbBYQM).  

This public repository currently contains:
- [Concept Paper](https://harmony-ren.github.io/public/harmony_ren_concept_paper.pdf)
- [Group hierarchy](hierarchy.md)
- [Contact information](contact.md)

As time passes and the group evolves, we will prepare learning materials to distribute online and refine this group's structure, external feedback is more than appreciated.
